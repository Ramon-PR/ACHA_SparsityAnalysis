1. Introduction

This package is a free collection of Matlab routines for computing
wave atom transforms in one, two and three dimensions. The
implementation is described in detail in the following two papers:

(a) L. Demanet, L. Ying, Wave atoms and sparsity of oscillatory
patterns, to appear in Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal. 2007.

(b) L. Demanet, L. Ying, Curvelets and wave atoms for mirror-extended
images, technical report. 2007.

Both of them can be downloaded from www.waveatom.org.

2. List of files

Most of the transform functions have two versions: standard and
symmetric. In the standard version, the coefficients are organized in
a cell array as described in the papers. In the symmetric version, the
coefficients are stored in an array. The symmetric version is
particularly useful for applications like thresholding.
